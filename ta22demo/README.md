# Tandy Assembly 2022

I presented a tech talk called *Using an Oscilloscope to Troubleshoot TRS-80s*.
You can see it
[here](https://www.youtube.com/live/l8FbDMca7As?si=2V_L1v6tEnEB16am) and also
see the
[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yte-w5xFYK9Rk3OoJwhJM8q7byucBD4rniTGt6crxTk/edit?usp=sharing).

Also this was a big event because Vernon Hestor attended and gave a great
presentation. I facilitated helping Vernon get MULTIDOS working on the FreHD.
Which was demonstrated at Tandy Assembly at my table.
