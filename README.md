# bigmit software

Retro computing code for the TRS-80. Mostly z80 assembly language. This is Tim
Halloran's code site.

Why *bigmit*? A homage to [Big Five Software](http://www.trs-80.org/big-five/).

## Interesting stuff

* [z80unit](./z80unit) &ndash; A programmer-friendly unit testing library for
  TRS-80 assembly. Supports all z80 TRS-80s and most DOSs.

## Tandy Assembly

I've been to every Tandy Assembly except the first one.

* [Tandy Assembly 2019 VBLANK Modification Exhibit](./ta19demo) &ndash; This
  directory contains the z80 assembly code for my Tandy Assembly 2019
  Raycaster.  I exhibited at Tandy Assembly 2019 with George Phillips the
  Model I no-chip VBLANK Modification. Includes a few pictures of the conference
  this was the year we were in the Museum across from the Courtyard.

* [Tandy Assembly 2021 Modern z80 Assembly Programming](./ta21demo) &ndash;
  This directory contains the example source code from my Tandy Assembly 2021
  introduction tutorial to modern TRS-80 z80 assembly programming using George
  Phillip's toolchain. Includes a few pictures of the conference.

* [Tandy Assembly 2022 Oscilloscope use and MULTIDOS on the FreHD](./ta22demo) &ndash;
  This directory contains the Oscillascope troubleshooting tech track talk I
  did from Tandy Assembly 2022. Vernon Hester was at the show showing off newly
  released MULTDOS for FreHD. Includes a few pictures of the confernece.

* [Tandy Assembly 2023 ChromaTRS, trs80gp RealSerial, and MULTIDOS Use](./ta23demo) &ndash;
  This directory contains the ChromaTRS demo I did from Tandy Assembly 2023.
  It includes a new Chroma BASIC program `TA23/BAS` just for the show.
  I also showed off trs80gp using real serial ports which was work with George Phillips.
  An emulated Xenix system was hooked up to a real Digital VT100 terminal.
  I gave a talk on MULTIDOS use at the conference.

* [Tandy Assembly 2024 Steve Leininger and Don French arrive](./ta24demo) &ndash;
  This was fun meeting the creators of the Model 1 TRS-80. My exibit had an
  original Model 1 4K level 1 system and a hot rod Model 1 with tons of modifications
  that Steve Leininger enjoyed seeing. I did a tech talk on using a Logic Analyzer.
