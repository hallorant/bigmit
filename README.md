# bigmit software

Retro computing code for the TRS-80. Mostly z80 assembly language. This is Tim
Halloran's code site.

Why *bigmit*? A homage to [Big Five Software](http://www.trs-80.org/big-five/).
At first I thought, *Big Tim Software*, but that seemed ackward and I get a lot
of programming help from the TRS-80 community, so I reversed the letters of
*tim* to *mit*. That and the project name *bigmit* was available here on
github.

## Interesting stuff

* [z80unit](./z80unit) &ndash; A programmer-friendly unit testing library for
  TRS-80 assembly. Supports all z80 TRS-80s and most DOSs.

* [Tandy Assembly 2019 VBLANK Modification Exhibit](./ta19demo) &ndash; This
  directory contains the z80 assembly code for my Tandy Assembly 2019
  Raycaster.  I exhibited at Tandy Assembly 2019 with George Phillips the
  Model I no-chip VBLANK Modification. Includes a few pictures of the conference.
