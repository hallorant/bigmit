# bigmit software

Retro computing code for the TRS-80. Mostly z80 assembly language. This is Tim
Halloran's code site.

Why *bigmit*? A homage to [Big Five Software](http://www.trs-80.org/big-five/).
I thought *Big Tim Software*, but that seemed ackward and I get a lot of
programming help from the TRS-80 community, so I reversed the letters of *tim*
to *mit*.

## Interesting stuff

* [z80unit](./z80unit) A programmer-friendly unit testing library for TRS-80
  assembly.
