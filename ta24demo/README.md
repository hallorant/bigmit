# Tandy Assembly 2024

This was a big one! Steve Leininger and Don French attended. The creators of
the TRS-80 were in the building and very generous with their time. Steve
Leininger gave the KeyNote. On the CoCo side Rick Adams gave a great "war
story" talk.

I was also thrilled to show off my all-Model-1-demo table exhibit to Steve
Leininger. He spent a long time with me and George Phillips as we showed off
hardware and software hacks to the Model 1. 

I did a tech talk entitled *Using a Logic Analyzer to Understand and
Troubleshoot TRS-80s*.  You can see
