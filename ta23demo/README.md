# Tandy Assembly 2023 

I did a tech talk entitled *Using MULTIDOS: An Introduction for Today's TRS-80
Enthusiast*.  You can see
[here](https://youtu.be/3Ws1bQWp534?si=Doy5wuErdnfyRL8P). The slides are
[here](./ta23multidos.pdf).

My table was a A ChromaTRS demo as described [here](./chromatrs). I also was
showing off [trs80gp](http://48k.ca/trs80gp.html) being able to map the
emulator to real serial terminals. I ran the emulator with Xenis on a Pi400 and
connected a real vt100 and a TRS-80 Color Computer 3 runnning a terminal
emulator.
