# FMG Corporation CP/M version 1.5 for the Model 1

This is a remapped version of CP/M that runs on a stock Model 1 with disks.
The disk images are setup for a TRS-80 Model 1 with a Gotek or with
[trs80gp](http://48k.ca/trs80gp.html).

## Keyboard remapping

* FMG CP/M uses ↓ for the Ctrl key. So to press Ctrl-Z you would
  hold down the ↓ key and then press Z. This is much easier to do on a
  real Model 1 keyboard than an emulator using a modern keyboard.
