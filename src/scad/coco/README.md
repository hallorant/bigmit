# TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo) 3d-printed Cases

This directory contains [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) designs for
3d-printed cartridges for Ian Mavrick's modern replacements. This includes the
CoCo Diagnostic cartridge, the CoCo RS-232 cartridge, and the FD-501 CoCo
floppy disk controller cartridge.

These are all remixes for [fiscap](https://www.thingiverse.com/fiscap) which
was calld the [TRS-80 Color Computer RE-FD-502
Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5470278).

In some ways mine are actually worse than what fiscap did for the FD-501. The
fiscap design is really nice but I found it hard to 3d-print. the changes I've
made are

* I made the top and bottom flat (removing the indent) so it would print with
* better quality. Simply lay the tops and bottoms on the printer deck, with the
  sides going up. This should print well even on cheap printers.
* For the FD-510 the floppy opening was pretty tight I made it larger (should
  fit most cables now).
* Added a design for Ian's RS-232 pack.
* Added a design for Ian's Diagnostics cartridge.
